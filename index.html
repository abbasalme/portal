       <p>This webpage will be dedicated towards my development in software development . I will be linking my portfolio on this webpage as well. I want to showcase my journey and track my progress at the same time.  </p>       
       <p> Hello, My Name is Abbas Alme, I am an emerging professional at the Year Up workforce 
        program. I am currently in the App Dev track to learn coding. I have worked as a security 
        guard at Facebook which initially sparked my interest in tech. Working as a security guard enhanced my awareness and reporting skills. As of now, I am working on becoming a programmer. I am driven and motivated to learn code. The job I am currently striving for  is a software developer. Above is my linkedin account.
       </p>
           
      <p>My skills include teamwork and communication. I strive in team settings where I share a common goal with coworkers. I have a deep desire to learn and better myself day in and day out. My eagerness for improvement in every aspect of my life is what separates me from my peers</p>
